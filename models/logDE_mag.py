"""
The function below is the exact function decribing the FLRW model with two paramters, Hubble constant and matter density. Note this is a 2-parameter FIT OF FLAT SPACETIME WITH DARK ENERGY

Z is the redshift astronomers wrongly use as the recession velocity.
m_B is the "distance magnitude" calculated from signals using a blue filter
Error_m_B is the standard deviation about m_B
"""
def logDE_mag(Z, Hubble, Matter):
    return 5*np.log10(_portion1(Z, Hubble) * _vectorizedIntersum(Z, Matter))+25

"""
This second portion is the function to be integrated which is mag version of equation E5 of DOI: 10.5772/intechopen.91266. The next definition is the function needed for integration
"""
def _portion2(Z, Matter):
    return 1/(np.sqrt((1+Z)**2)*(1+Matter*Z) - 2*(2+Z)*(1-Matter))

"""
This definition is the integration process, note the integration is from 0 to Z and not x to 1 as per the equation E5.
"""
def _intersum(Z, Matter):
    return quad(_portion2, 0, Z, args=(Matter))[0]
_vectorizedIntersum = np.vectorize(_intersum, excluded=["Matter"])

"""
This is a simple calculation of the pre-integral portion of E5

def _portion1(Z, Hubble):
    return speed_of_light*(1+Z)/Hubble
